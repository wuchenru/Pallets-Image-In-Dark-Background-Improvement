This code defines an ExposureAdjustmentLoss class for enhancing image brightness to a desired target mean

 It uses average pooling to calculate the mean brightness of the modified image. 
 The loss is computed as the squared difference between the computed mean and the target mean brightness.
   
This loss encourages adjusting the image's overall exposure to match the desired level,
 making it suitable for dark environments. It's a fundamental component for image enhancement 
 and optimization.
